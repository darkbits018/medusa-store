### Prerequisites

- Medusa Server (Link to [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) here).
- Create an account in service X (for integrations with other services).
- Redis, PostgreSQL, or any of Medusa’s configurations or plugins.

### Install Project

To check if you have Node.js and NPM installed you can run these commands:
```
node -v
npm -v

```
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkbits018/medusa-store.git
```

Install Medusa

Installing Medusa is easy. First, you need to install the CLI tool that allows you to set up the server:
```
npm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli

```

Run Medusa

Once this command is done, you are ready to run your server! First, change to the directory of the medusa store:
```
cd my-store
```
Then, run the develop command using the CLI tool to run the server:
```
medusa develop
```
This will run the server by default at localhost:9000.

To run the storefront, first change to the directory of the storefront:
```
cd my-storefront
```
Then, run the following command to run the storefront:
```
npm run dev
```
This will run the storefront at localhost:8000 by default.
